# Stocks-Price-Prediction
This is a stocks price prediction project using three models that is Moving Average, LSTM, ITransformers. LSTM performs the best but ITransformers shows the potential and it will work best if we provide more data. There are two kinds of data used in this project. firstly we have used the random data generated by using Randomseed() and then by the use of yfinance library we have imported the TCS data of time duration 1 year.
